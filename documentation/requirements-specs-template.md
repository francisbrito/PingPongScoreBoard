# Requirements specification template

We strive to keep the documentation as simple to understand as possible, so that it can be validated, reviewed and rewritten with least effort. As such, we optted for using *agile **user stories*** as requirement specification template.

## Agile User Story structure

> As a `role`, I'd like to `want/desire`, so that I can `benefit`.
